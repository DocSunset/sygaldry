[TOC]

This document describes the CMake script for the helpers library.

Most of the functionality of the helpers library is header-only compile time
code that can't easily be physically isolated from its point of use due to the
implementation strategy. As such, the library's main function is to collect the
include directories that need to be exposed to clients of the library.

```cmake
# @#'CMakeLists.txt'
add_library(sygaldry_helpers INTERFACE)
target_link_libraries(sygaldry_helpers INTERFACE Sygaldry::Utilities)
target_include_directories(sygaldry_helpers INTERFACE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}")
add_library(Sygaldry::Helpers ALIAS sygaldry_helpers)

if (SYGALDRY_BUILD_TESTS)
add_subdirectory("tests/metadata")
add_subdirectory("tests/endpoints")
add_subdirectory("tests/mimu")
endif()
# @/
```
