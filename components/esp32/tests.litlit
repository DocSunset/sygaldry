# ESP32 Component Tests

Tests in this directory are compiled as ESP32 component tests using the native
toolchain. This document sets up the boilerplate necessary to compile and
detect these tests. 

ESP-IDF provides a unit testing app based on its component structure, but due
to the way the framework is installed on my system, it's a PITA to use, requiring
super user priviledges, and generally not meeting my requirements. For this
reason, the given method is eschewed, which means we have to come up with our
own way of running tests on the device.

For now we make a plain old ESP32 project that just happens to run our tests in
its `app_main` subroutine. This requires a frustrating amount of bookkeeping:
we need to manually include all of the tests *and* remember to then run them.
