[TOC]

This document describes the CMake script for the concepts library.

Most of the functionality of the concepts library is header-only compile time
code that can't easily be physically isolated from its point of use due to the
implementation strategy. As such, the library's main function is to collect the
include directories that need to be exposed to clients of the library.

```cmake
# @#'CMakeLists.txt'
add_library(sygaldry_concepts INTERFACE)
target_link_libraries(sygaldry_concepts INTERFACE Sygaldry::Utilities)
target_include_directories(sygaldry_concepts INTERFACE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../dependencies/mp11/include"
        INTERFACE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../dependencies/pfr/include"
        INTERFACE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../dependencies/mp11/include"
        INTERFACE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}"
        )
add_library(Sygaldry::Concepts ALIAS sygaldry_concepts)

if (SYGALDRY_BUILD_TESTS)
add_subdirectory("tests/functions")
add_subdirectory("tests/endpoints")
add_subdirectory("tests/components")
add_subdirectory("tests/mimu")
add_subdirectory("tests/runtime")
endif()
