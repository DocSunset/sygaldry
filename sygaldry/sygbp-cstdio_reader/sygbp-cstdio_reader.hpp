/*! \brief Command line input reader using standard IO calls

This reader calls `getc` to get one character. There are some limitations to
this implementation:

- `ready()` needs to be called once before every call to `getchar()`, which doesn't actually
  get any characters
- on some platforms, `getc` is blocking, and this implementation cannot be used

It remains as future work to resolve the latter issue, but the former is
considered part of the API. Beware!
