/*! \brief Change the order of the elements in an array or array-like endpoint

\param[in] in The input array to reorder.
\param[out] out An array in which the reordered output can be written.
\param[in] size The expected number of elements in the in, out, and order arrays.
\param[in] order

A specification of the output order, such that the nth element `order[n]`
states the index into the input array from which the nth element of the output
should be given. E.g. to reverse a 3-element input, give `order = {2,1,0};`.

\warning

It is assumed without checking to that all elements of `order` are valid
indices into the input array, e.g. non-negative integers less than `size`, and
that all arrays have at least `size` elements. If either assumption is invalid,
an out of bounds memory access will occur resulting in undefined behaviour
(likely a crash). Use one of the overloads below for greater static safety
guarantees.
