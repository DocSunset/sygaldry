[TOC]

Sygaldry currently only facilitates firmware development, so you'll have to
work out the electronic and physical design of your instrument using existing
methods. However, using existing software components in the library, Sygaldry
can greatly simplify development of the firmware for many instrument designs.

# The Runtime

The foundation of a Sygaldry instrument is the runtime, described in detail in
\ref page-sygac-runtime (literate source), with reference documentation
available [here](\ref sygaldry::Runtime).

Using the runtime, implementing the firmware for an instrument is as simple as
listing its components, `constexpr` instantiating the runtime, and then calling
init and tick:

```cpp
#include "sygac-runtime.hpp"
// #include various component headers here

struct MyMinimumInstrument
{
    // ... components here
} my_minimum_instrument;

constexpr auto runtime = Runtime{my_minimum_instrument};

int main()
{
    runtime.init();
    while (true) runtime.tick();
}
```

The runtime is implemented by a C++ class template `sygaldry::Runtime`. It
takes one template type argument that should be a Sygaldry assembly. A Sygaldry
assembly is defined recursively as a `struct` that contains only
[Sygadlry components](\ref page-docs-making_a_new_component) or Sygaldry assemblies.

Sygaldry assemblies are aggregate type `struct`s, which allows their data
members to be enumerated and iterated over at compile time. This allows the
runtime to automatically call the `init()` and `main()` subroutines of all the
components in the subassembly.

The runtime `init()` method will initialize all of the components in the order
they are instantiated (which may be different than the order they are declared)
in the assembly. The runtime `tick()` method will run the components' main
subroutines in the same order. All you have to do is call `init()` once, then
run `tick()` in a loop forever.

It's important to initialize the runtime `constexpr`, as seen above, for boring
technical reasons that are elaborated in \ref page-sygac-runtime.

# Bindings

Binding components automatically reflect over the endpoints of a component or
assembly in order to automatically generate useful code at compile time, such
as bindings to communication protocols like Open Sound Control.

For example, here is the implementation of a very simple instrument, using an
ESP32, that consists of a single button exposed over the network using Open
Sound Control:

```cpp
#include "sygse-button.hpp"
#include "sygbe-wifi.hpp"
#include "sygbp-liblo.hpp"

using namespace sygaldry;

struct OneBitBongo
{
    sygse::Button<GPIO_NUM_15> button;
    sygbe::WiFi wifi;
    sygbp::LibloOsc<decltype(button)> osc;
} bongo{};

constexpr auto runtime = Runtime{bongo};

extern "C" void app_main(void)
{
    runtime.init();
    vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(100));
    while (true)
    {
        runtime.tick();
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(10));
    }
}
```

Notice how the button component's type is passed to `LibloOSC` as a type
template parameter. This enables the binding to generate appropriate code to
expose the button's endpoints over the network *at compile time*, giving
runtime performance similar to if the binding had been written by hand.

We access the button's type as `decltype(button)` instead of rewriting
`sygse::Button<GPIO_NUM_15>` to avoid duplicating the specification
of which GPIO pin the button uses.

In the `OneBitBongo` example above, there is only one component worth binding.
In more typical instrument designs, there are generally more sensors than one
button. Rather than listing all of these components explicitly for every
binding, we instead wrap all the components that need to be bound by a given
binding in a simple aggregate struct that we term as a subassembly. We can then
pass the subassembly to bindings, which will expose all of the components
contained in it. For example, supposing we wanted to have two buttons, we could
write the following:

```cpp
struct TwoBitBongo
{
    struct Buttons {
        sygse::Button<GPIO_NUM_15> button1;
        sygse::Button<GPIO_NUM_16> button2;
    } buttons;
    sygbe::WiFi wifi;
    sygbp::LibloOsc<Buttons> osc;
} bongo{};
```

# Important Bindings

There are a few bindings that almost all instruments will want to use.

## Session Storage

Many components need to save information persistently across power cycles.
Session storage binding components serve this requirement by saving the values
of endpoints marked with the session data tag in persistent storage such as
flash memory or EEPROM.

It's important that the session storage component is the first component
instantiated in an assembly. Since it also generally needs to bind over
numerous other components, this usually requires a subassembly to be defined
before the session storage, and then instantiated after the session storage, as
in the example below.

## CLI

To facilitate initial set up of parameters like network credentials and OSC
ports, a serial command line interface is provided by a CLI component. This
allows e.g. the network to be initially set up after the firmware is first
flashed, as well as allowing sensitive parameters that should not be globally
exposed over the network to be configured only by those with physical access to
the instrument. The CLI can also be very useful when debugging.

## Example

On ESP32 for example, most instruments will have a structure similar to the
following:

```cpp
struct MyTypicalInstrument
{
    struct Instrument {
        struct Sensors {
            sygse::Button<GPIO_NUM_15> button;
            // ... etc.
        } sensors;
        sygbe::WiFi wifi;
        sygbp::LibloOsc<Sensors> osc;
        // ... other bindings
    };
    sygbe::SpiffsSessionStorage<Instrument> session_storage;
    Instrument instrument;
    sygbp::CstdioCli<Instrument> cli;
} my_typical_instrument{};
```

Notice how the `session_storage` component is instantiated before the
`instrument`, but after the definition of `struct Instrument`. This allows
`Instrument` to be passed as a type template parameter to the session storage
component (which requires the definition of `Instrument` to be available
already) before the `instrument` is instantiated in the `struct`. This allows
the session storage component to be run by the runtime before the other
components, so that other components will be initialized after their session
data has been restored.

# Platform Specific Extras

Many platforms will require additional information beyond the instrument
definition, such as for setting up the build system or configuring the
environment.

Since instrument implementations are naturally quite declarative, we place less
emphasis on their literate prose documentation and reference documentation.
